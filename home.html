    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>Why are printers univerally so difficult to master? 
      <br>
      <br>
      How many more office-based soap operas featuring employees banging on their desks and office appliances 
      for us to recognize the long-standing flawed usability of printers?
      <br>
      <br>
      In our first project for CS1300, we were asked to observe real users interacting with an interface, 
      interview these individuals about their experiences, create personas based on these users, 
      and illustrate a storyboard for one of our personas. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Read on for the process and persona construction of my childhood printer:  
      <b>The HP Officejet Pro 6830</b>

    <h2>Part 1: Preparations</h2>
    <p>
      We were asked to select interfaces in public view to conduct contextual inquiry. 
      Given the physical restrictions imposed by social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      I chose a widely used interface that was in the safety of my own home back in San Francisco instead– 
      the navigation screen of my trusty HP Officejet Pro 6830 Printer! 
    </p>

      <b>Interface Description:</b>
      My chosen interface controls what function the printer should be executing, whether copying, faxing, or scanning, 
      along with configuring the print settings. 
      <br>
      <br>
      This is all executed on a small touch screen screen on the side of the printer.

    <h2>Part 2: Recording Observations</h2>
    <p>Because my interface was at home, I decided to observe the three people that are staying there– 
      my Mom, Dad, and Uncle. With the assistance of FaceTime, I was able to observe each of them print 
      something of their choosing and navigate the interface. 
      <br>
      <br>
      From their reactions and behavior, I asked additional interview questions to further understand their experience 
      and motives.

    <h2>Part 3: Personas</h2>
    <h3><b>Empathy Maps + Descriptions</b></h3>
    <p>From the collected responses and observations, I created empathy maps for two different personas, 
      Confused Cameron and Motivated Monica. I was surprised by just how accurately these two personas 
      summed up my experience with printers in the past– so many people are on polar opposites on the spectrum 
      of comfort when it comes to printers.

    <h2>Part 4: Storyboards</h2>
    <p>When Confused Cameron is required to make a photo copy of his driver’s license for a job application, 
      he struggles to use the printer.

    <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
    <p>Being dropped in the deep and and having to actively observe and create my own personas gave me an in-depth 
      crash course about personas, giving me a better idea of what a persona is and how they are developed. 
      I also got to see my uncle, who’s usually so sure of himself, fumble with a printer for fifteen minutes– 
      that’s one way to bond with family while socially distant!
